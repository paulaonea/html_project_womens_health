        <p class="paragraph">This section provides real advice on how to achieve your fittest and strongest self yet.  
            It includes workout tips, recovery advice and how to train well.</p>
        <h3 class="subsection-title">Exercise: Why Fitness Matters</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">Being fit improves your health. A lifetime of fitness offers many benefits like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Decreasing your risk of health problems, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and some types of cancer</span></li>
            <li><span>Managing your weight</span></li>
            <li><span>Helping you sleep better</span></li>
            <li><span>Preventing or relieving stress, depression, and back problems</span></li>
            <li><span>Boosting your energy</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paragraph">You need to continue exercising to keep these benefits. Your main goal is to make fitness a lifetime commitment. 
            Build a fitness plan that you can stick with. Choose activities you like. 
            Go slowly, especially when just starting out. Work up to being active 30 minutes on most days. 
            Aim for a total of 150 or more minutes a week.</p>
        <h3 class="subsection-title">Why be fit?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">People who are physically fit:</p>
        <ul class="unordered-list">
            <li><span>Are more alert and productive</span></li>
            <li><span>Have more energy, both physically and mentally</span></li>
            <li><span>Handle stress better</span></li>
            <li><span>Sleep better</span></li>
            <li><span>Are less prone to injury</span></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="subsection-title">Check your health first</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">If you answer yes to any of the questions below, you should talk to 
            your healthcare provider before starting a fitness program:</p>
        <ul class="unordered-list">
            <li><span>Has a healthcare provider ever said you have heart trouble?</span></li>
            <li><span>Do you ever have chest pains?</span></li>
            <li><span>Do you often feel faint or have dizzy spells?</span></li>
            <li><span>Has a provider ever said your blood pressure is too high?</span></li>
            <li><span>Has a provider ever said that you have a bone or joint problem that could be made worse by exercise?</span></li>
            <li><span>Do you take any prescription medicines for problems such as diabetes or asthma?</span></li>
            <li><span>Talking with your provider before beginning a new exercise program is a good idea for anyone.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="subsection-title">Will I lose weight?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">Many of us would like to lose or keep off a few pounds. 
            Being more active each day and building muscle can help. Here’s how:</p>
        <ul class="unordered-list">
            <li><span>Being active burns calories. You burn nearly twice as many calories just walking slowly as you do sitting.</span></li>
            <li><span>Muscle burns more calories than fat. So the more muscle you build up from activity, the more calories you burn.</span></li>
            <li><span>If you add more muscle, you’ll use more calories even when you’re not being active.</span></li>
            <li><span>Being active helps you keep more muscle as you age. More muscle means it will be easier to control your weight.</span></li>
        </ul>
