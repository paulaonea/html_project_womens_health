                    What is the best way to lose fat?
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-hidden" id="a1">
                <p>The simple (and complex) answer is that there is no “best way” to lose fat or a simple "recipe" that works for everyone. 
                    The most effective way however is to <b>combine healthy eating and a low carbon diet with a tailored training programe</b>. 
                </p>
                <p> Regarding the training programe, each person will respond differently to a specific programe, but there are some principles 
                    that fitness professionals can apply when designing your programs.
                </p>
                <p> Activities that incorporate many muscle groups and are weight bearing use more calories per minute and are 
                    therefore better suited for fat loss than non-weight-bearing activities that do not use many muscles.
                    It is often assumed that low-intensity exercise is best for burning fat. During exercise at a very low intensity, 
                    fat does account for most of the energy expenditure, while at a moderate intensity, fat accounts for only about 
                    50 percent of the energy used. However, since the number of calories used per minute is much greater at a moderate 
                    to high intensity than at a low intensity, the total number of calories expended during a moderate- to high-intensity 
                    workout is greater than it is during a low- intensity workout of the same duration; consequently, the total number of 
                    fat calories expended is also greater during the higher-intensity workout. The rate of energy expenditure, rather 
                    than simply the percentage of energy expenditure derived from fat, is important in determining the exercise intensity 
                    that will use the most fat. Furthermore, endurance-trained individuals rely less on carbohydrates and more on fat 
                    as a fuel source during submaximal exercise (Kiens 1997). Thus, the more aerobically trained you become, 
                    the more fat you will use during subsequent exercise sessions.
                </p>
                <p> To decrease body fat percentage, you do not necessarily have to use fat during exercise. Much of the fat from 
                    adipose tissue (as opposed to intramuscular fat, which is primarily used during exercise) is lost in the hours 
                    following exercise. Moreover, the amount of fat lost after a workout depends, in part, on the exercise intensity
                    during the workout. Following high-intensity exercise, the rate of fat oxidation is higher than it is following 
                    low-intensity exercise (Mulla et al. 2000; Phelain et al. 1997). Because clients can perform a greater intensity 
                    of work if the work is broken up with periods of rest, interval training is a great way to perform high-intensity 
                    work and help decrease body fat percentage.
                </p>
                <p>Both strength training and endurance exercise have been shown to decrease body fat percentage. However, aerobic 
                    exercise appears to have a greater impact on fat loss than does strength training (Ballor et al. 1996; Dolezal & 
                    Potteiger 1998; LeMura et al. 2000). A combination of endurance and strength training results in more fat loss than 
                    either exercise regimen alone (Dolezal & Potteiger 1998), possibly because clients who perform both activities 
                    spend more time exercising.

                <p class="question" id="q2">
                    If I lift weights, will I get bigger muscles??
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-hidden" id="a2">
                <p>Whether or not you will get bigger muscles (called <i>hypertrophy</i>) depends on three basic factors: <b>genetics, 
                    gender</b> and <b>training intensity</b>. Genetics is mostly manifested as muscle fiber type; people with predominantly 
                    fast-twitch fibers acquire larger muscles more easily than people with predominantly slow-twitch fibers. 
                    In relation to gender, males acquire larger muscles than females do, because males have greater amounts 
                    of testosterone and other sex hormones that influence protein metabolism (Tipton 2001). Thus, females 
                    experience less muscle hypertrophy with strength improvement than males do (Lewis et al. 1986). Training 
                    intensity is the only factor you can control.
                </p>
                <p>Hypertrophy results from an increase in the number of contractile proteins (actin and myosin, produced 
                    by the body in response to training), which in turn increases the size of the muscle fibers.
                </p>If the training goal is hypertrophy, the load lifted should be at least 80 percent of the one-repetition 
                maximum (1 RM), as a general guideline (Zatsiorsky 1995). If you are not interested in developing larger 
                muscles, keep the load less than 80 percent of 1 RM. However, hypertrophy can be stimulated any time the 
                training intensity is high enough to overload the muscle. Thus, if you have never lifted weights before, 
                60 percent of 1 RM may be enough to cause slight hypertrophy, especially if you are predisposed to hypertrophy 
                by having a large proportion of fast-twitch fibers.

                    How do I get a flat stomach?
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-hidden" id="a3">
                <p>Genetics also plays a role in whether or not you can obtain a flat stomach or a “six-pack” look to your 
                    abdominals. Having said that, two types of exercise can help: <strong>strength training</strong> and <strong> 
                    exercise</strong>. The abdominals are just like any other muscle group: for their definition to become visible, they must grow 
                    larger and the fat that lies over them must decrease. What makes the definition of the abdominals so difficult 
                    to see is that they are situated in the area of the body that contains the most fat. Strength training the 
                    abdominals is only half the story. You will get a flat stomach only if you combine strength training with 
                    cardiovascular exercise to get rid of the fat. Most people do not do nearly enough cardiovascular exercise 
                    to decrease their body fat percentage to a point where they would see their abdominals. Even when the aerobic 
                    exercise stimulus is adequate, the role of diet must not be underestimated. All people with a flat stomach or 
                    six-pack have a very low percentage of body fat.
                </p>
                <p>Abdominal crunches are just as effective as any piece of equipment to train the rectus abdominis muscle, 
                    the main muscle in the abdominal region (Demont et al. 1999; Vaz et al. 1999). As you improve your abdominal 
                    strength, you can make crunches more demanding by performing them on a movable surface, such as a resistance 
                    ball (Vera-Garcia et al. 2000).
                </p> 
                <p>You should be very careful though with abdominal crunches as they may lead to displasis recti by adding lots of 
                    extra pressure on the linea alba.

                    Should I do cardio first or weight training first?
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-hidden" id="a4">
                <p>It depends on your goals. Many personal trainers think that performing strength training before 
                    cardiovascular exercise will augment the amount of fat used during the cardio workout because the strength 
                    training will deplete the muscles’ store of carbohydrates (glycogen). However, strength training is not 
                    likely to deplete glycogen stores, because a lot of the workout time is spent resting between sets and 
                    exercises. Even if the strength workout were long and intense enough to accomplish this task, exercising 
                    in a glycogen-depleted state has many negative consequences, including an increase in acidic compounds 
                    produced in response to low carbohydrate levels, low blood insulin, hypoglycemia, increased amino acid 
                    (protein) metabolism, increased blood and muscle ammonia and a strong perception of fatigue. Currently, 
                    no research shows that strength training immediately before a cardio workout increases the amount of fat 
                    used during the cardio workout, or vice versa. Most likely, the intensity of the activity, not the mode 
                    of exercise, determines the “fuel”—either fat, carbohydrate or protein—that is used. However, if you 
                    strength train first, it is possible that muscle fatigue incurred from the strength training could cause 
                    them to decrease the intensity of their subsequent cardio workout, thus leading them to expend fewer 
                    calories over the workout as a whole.
                </p>
                <p>If you the primary goal is to increase aerobic endurance or lose weight, then you should perform 
                    cardiovascular exercise first. If you primary goal is to increase muscular strength, then you should 
                    perform strength training first. Basically, in order to get the most out of the workout, you should perform 
                    the most important type of exercise when yuo are nor fatigued. Because many people want to lose weight and 
                    increase muscular strength, alternating the order of the workout during different cycles of training is one way 
                    to satisfy both goals.

                    How do I get rid of these flabby arms?
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-hidden" id="a5">
                <p>One of the biggest exercise myths is that you can lose fat in an area of the body by strength training or 
                    exercising that specific body part. The truth is that “spot reducing” and “spot toning” do not work, 
                    because we cannot dictate from where our bodies will decide to oxidize fat, nor can we change fat into 
                    muscle. Doing triceps press-downs will not decrease the amount of fat that  you have on the backs of your 
                    arms any more than doing crunches will decrease the amount of fat you have on you stomach.
                        
                    As you age, the skin will become less elastic and thus conform less to the arms. So “flabby arms” are 
                    somewhat a product of age. Any exercise that decreases body fat percentage will help you lose fat on your 
                    arms, just as it will help you lose fat from other areas of the body.
