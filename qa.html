                    What is the best way to lose fat?
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-hidden" id="a1">
                <p>The simple (and complex) answer is that there is no “best way” to lose fat or a simple "recipe" that
                    works for everyone.
                    The most effective way however is to <b>combine healthy eating and a low carbon diet with a tailored
                        training programe</b>.
                </p>
                <p> Regarding the training programe, each person will respond differently to a specific programe, but
                    there are some principles
                    that fitness professionals can apply when designing your programs.
                </p>
                <p> Activities that incorporate many muscle groups and are weight bearing use more calories per minute
                    and are
                    therefore better suited for fat loss than non-weight-bearing activities that do not use many
                    muscles.
                    It is often assumed that low-intensity exercise is best for burning fat. During exercise at a very
                    low intensity,
                    fat does account for most of the energy expenditure, while at a moderate intensity, fat accounts for
                    only about
                    50 percent of the energy used. However, since the number of calories used per minute is much greater
                    at a moderate
                    to high intensity than at a low intensity, the total number of calories expended during a moderate-
                    to high-intensity
                    workout is greater than it is during a low- intensity workout of the same duration; consequently,
                    the total number of
                    fat calories expended is also greater during the higher-intensity workout. The rate of energy
                    expenditure, rather
                    than simply the percentage of energy expenditure derived from fat, is important in determining the
                    exercise intensity
                    that will use the most fat. Furthermore, endurance-trained individuals rely less on carbohydrates
                    and more on fat
                    as a fuel source during submaximal exercise (Kiens 1997). Thus, the more aerobically trained you
                    become,
                    the more fat you will use during subsequent exercise sessions.
                </p>
                <p> To decrease body fat percentage, you do not necessarily have to use fat during exercise. Much of the
                    fat from
                    adipose tissue (as opposed to intramuscular fat, which is primarily used during exercise) is lost in
                    the hours
                    following exercise. Moreover, the amount of fat lost after a workout depends, in part, on the
                    exercise intensity
                    during the workout. Following high-intensity exercise, the rate of fat oxidation is higher than it
                    is following
                    low-intensity exercise (Mulla et al. 2000; Phelain et al. 1997). Because clients can perform a
                    greater intensity
                    of work if the work is broken up with periods of rest, interval training is a great way to perform
                    high-intensity
                    work and help decrease body fat percentage.
                </p>
                <p>Both strength training and endurance exercise have been shown to decrease body fat percentage.
                    However, aerobic
                    exercise appears to have a greater impact on fat loss than does strength training (Ballor et al.
                    1996; Dolezal &
                    Potteiger 1998; LeMura et al. 2000). A combination of endurance and strength training results in
                    more fat loss than
                    either exercise regimen alone (Dolezal & Potteiger 1998), possibly because clients who perform both
                    activities
                    spend more time exercising.

                <p class="question" id="q2">
                    If I lift weights, will I get bigger muscles??
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-hidden" id="a2">
                <p>Whether or not you will get bigger muscles (called <i>hypertrophy</i>) depends on three basic
                    factors: <b>genetics,
                        gender</b> and <b>training intensity</b>. Genetics is mostly manifested as muscle fiber type;
                    people with predominantly
                    fast-twitch fibers acquire larger muscles more easily than people with predominantly slow-twitch
                    fibers.
                    In relation to gender, males acquire larger muscles than females do, because males have greater
                    amounts
                    of testosterone and other sex hormones that influence protein metabolism (Tipton 2001). Thus,
                    females
                    experience less muscle hypertrophy with strength improvement than males do (Lewis et al. 1986).
                    Training
                    intensity is the only factor you can control.
                </p>
                <p>Hypertrophy results from an increase in the number of contractile proteins (actin and myosin,
                    produced
                    by the body in response to training), which in turn increases the size of the muscle fibers.
                </p>If the training goal is hypertrophy, the load lifted should be at least 80 percent of the
                one-repetition
                maximum (1 RM), as a general guideline (Zatsiorsky 1995). If you are not interested in developing larger
                muscles, keep the load less than 80 percent of 1 RM. However, hypertrophy can be stimulated any time the
                training intensity is high enough to overload the muscle. Thus, if you have never lifted weights before,
                60 percent of 1 RM may be enough to cause slight hypertrophy, especially if you are predisposed to
                hypertrophy
                by having a large proportion of fast-twitch fibers.

                <p class="question" id="q3">
                    How do I get a flat stomach?
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-hidden" id="a3">
                <p>Genetics also plays a role in whether or not you can obtain a flat stomach or a “six-pack” look to
                    your
                    abdominals. Having said that, two types of exercise can help: <strong>strength training</strong> and
                    <strong>
                        exercise</strong>. The abdominals are just like any other muscle group: for their definition to
                    become visible, they must grow
                    larger and the fat that lies over them must decrease. What makes the definition of the abdominals so
                    difficult
                    to see is that they are situated in the area of the body that contains the most fat. Strength
                    training the
                    abdominals is only half the story. You will get a flat stomach only if you combine strength training
                    with
                    cardiovascular exercise to get rid of the fat. Most people do not do nearly enough cardiovascular
                    exercise
                    to decrease their body fat percentage to a point where they would see their abdominals. Even when
                    the aerobic
                    exercise stimulus is adequate, the role of diet must not be underestimated. All people with a flat
                    stomach or
                    six-pack have a very low percentage of body fat.
                </p>
                <p>Abdominal crunches are just as effective as any piece of equipment to train the rectus abdominis
                    muscle,
                    the main muscle in the abdominal region (Demont et al. 1999; Vaz et al. 1999). As you improve your
                    abdominal
                    strength, you can make crunches more demanding by performing them on a movable surface, such as a
                    resistance
                    ball (Vera-Garcia et al. 2000).
                </p>
                <p>You should be very careful though with abdominal crunches as they may lead to displasis recti by
                    adding lots of
                    extra pressure on the linea alba.

                <p class="question" id="q4">
                    Should I do cardio first or weight training first?
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-hidden" id="a4">
                <p>It depends on your goals. Many personal trainers think that performing strength training before
                    cardiovascular exercise will augment the amount of fat used during the cardio workout because the
                    strength
                    training will deplete the muscles’ store of carbohydrates (glycogen). However, strength training is
                    not
                    likely to deplete glycogen stores, because a lot of the workout time is spent resting between sets
                    and
                    exercises. Even if the strength workout were long and intense enough to accomplish this task,
                    exercising
                    in a glycogen-depleted state has many negative consequences, including an increase in acidic
                    compounds
                    produced in response to low carbohydrate levels, low blood insulin, hypoglycemia, increased amino
                    acid
                    (protein) metabolism, increased blood and muscle ammonia and a strong perception of fatigue.
                    Currently,
                    no research shows that strength training immediately before a cardio workout increases the amount of
                    fat
                    used during the cardio workout, or vice versa. Most likely, the intensity of the activity, not the
                    mode
                    of exercise, determines the “fuel”—either fat, carbohydrate or protein—that is used. However, if you
                    strength train first, it is possible that muscle fatigue incurred from the strength training could
                    cause
                    them to decrease the intensity of their subsequent cardio workout, thus leading them to expend fewer
                    calories over the workout as a whole.
                </p>
                <p>If you the primary goal is to increase aerobic endurance or lose weight, then you should perform
                    cardiovascular exercise first. If you primary goal is to increase muscular strength, then you should
                    perform strength training first. Basically, in order to get the most out of the workout, you should
                    perform
                    the most important type of exercise when yuo are nor fatigued. Because many people want to lose
                    weight and
                    increase muscular strength, alternating the order of the workout during different cycles of training
                    is one way
                    to satisfy both goals.

                    How do I get rid of these flabby arms?
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-hidden" id="a5">
                <p>One of the biggest exercise myths is that you can lose fat in an area of the body by strength
                    training or
                    exercising that specific body part. The truth is that “spot reducing” and “spot toning” do not work,
                    because we cannot dictate from where our bodies will decide to oxidize fat, nor can we change fat
                    into
                    muscle. Doing triceps press-downs will not decrease the amount of fat that you have on the backs of
                    your
                    arms any more than doing crunches will decrease the amount of fat you have on you stomach.

                    As you age, the skin will become less elastic and thus conform less to the arms. So “flabby arms”
                    are
                    somewhat a product of age. Any exercise that decreases body fat percentage will help you lose fat on
                    your
                    arms, just as it will help you lose fat from other areas of the body.

                    Yes, these diets can be safe, but you should always
                    talk to your doctor or nurse before limiting the amount
                    of any specific nutrient like fat or carbs. Fats and carbs
                    are essential, which means your body needs them to
                    work correctly and for good health.</p>

                <p> •<strong> Low-carb diets </strong>can help you lose weight, but
                    they can also limit the amount of fiber you get
                    each day. Most women do not get enough fiber.</p>

                <p> • <strong> Low-fat diets </strong>also can help you lose weight. But
                    the amount of weight lost is usually small.
                    For weight loss, what is more important is eating
                    healthy carbs and unsaturated fats and limiting the
                    amount of calories you take in. It helps to cut out
                    or eat less of foods that don’t have essential vitamins,
                    minerals, or nutrients. Try one of the healthy eating

                    How to increase your iron intake?
                </p>

                    Iron can be found in offal (like liver and kidney), red meat, fish and shellfish (e.g. canned
                    sardines, cockles and mussels), beans, pulses, nuts and seeds, quinoa, wholemeal bread and dried
                    fruit.
                    Although liver is a good source of iron, you should avoid it if you are pregnant. This is because
                    liver is also rich in vitamin A which, in large amounts, can harm your unborn baby.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Iron found in plant foods is less readily absorbed than that from animal products like meat and
                    eggs. So if you are vegetarian or vegan you may need to be particularly careful to make sure you get
                    enough iron in your diet. However, vitamin C can help your body to absorb iron from plant sources so
                    try to combine foods or drinks high in vitamin C with those containing iron (e.g. adding broccoli
                    into a bean casserole or red pepper to a tofu stir-fry).

                    It is not known for sure but IBS symptoms may increase during or after eating high fat foods in some
                    individuals. Foods high in fat should be limited as part of a healthy, balanced diet. Women should
                    limit their intake of fat to no more 78 g per day.

                    Can changing the amount of fermentable carbohydrates in the diet improve IBS symptoms?

                <p>
                    Fermentable carbohydrates include FODMAPs. FODMAPs (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides,
                    Monosaccharides and Polyols) are small carbohydrates found in certain foods, including some cereals,
                    fruits and vegetables and sugars-free sweets. They are not digested in the small bowel (intestine)
                    but pass through to the large bowel where they are fermented by the gut bacteria. This can increase
                    fluid and gas production in the large intestine, which may increase IBS symptoms in susceptible
                    individuals. There is a reasonable amount of evidence to suggest that following a low FODMAP diet
                    may be beneficial for some individuals with IBS. If you are thinking about trying a low FODMAP diet
                    to help manage your symptoms, speak to a health professional (e.g. a dietitian) so they can make
                    sure you are still getting all the nutrients your body needs.

                    How to stay well hydrated?

                    Sufficient fluid intake is essential for exercise and optimum recovery. Exercising causes the body
                    to get warmer, so the body tries to cool down by sweating. This causes the loss of water and salts
                    through the skin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Small water losses are not harmful. However, dehydration (water loss in excess of 2-3% body mass)
                    can cause tiredness and hinder performance by reducing strength and aerobic capacity (especially in
                    longer duration exercise), as well as having a negative effect on any further exercise sessions. So,
                    try and stay hydrated before, during and after exercise to prevent dehydration – water is generally
                    best, but in cases of high-intensity exercise and excessive sweating, an isotonic drink may be
                    better (see later section that covers other drinks)
